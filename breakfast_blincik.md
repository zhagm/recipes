# Blinchik Recipe (Russian Crepes)

The best mornings growing up were those when I'd wake up to the smell of blinciks. I'd come downstairs to my mom at the stove working two hot pans, cooking up a stack of blinciks, flipping them with her hands. My favorite toppings were, in this order:
- Fruit jam and yogurt
- Just honey
- Ground beef - saute onions, add ground beef, salt, pepper, bay leaf

And some recent favorites are:
- Yogurt inside and maple syrup on top
- Egg, deli slice, a bit of cottage cheese, and a melted sliced cheese - like a galette
- Cottage cheese and honey (it's extra yummy if you blend the cottage cheese with a dash of vanilla extract)

I asked my mom for her recipe but as an intuitive cook who measures her ingredients by \**feel*\*, her guestimated measurements didn't work out for me. I ended up searching the internet for a recipe from a layperson like myself who uses measuring cups to cook and this is what I've found works for me. I may someday return to my experimenting and play around with the recipe, but for the time being I am satisfied with my months of effort bringing me to the recipe below.

To me, the perfect blincik is soft and gummy, moist, flavorful and only slightly sweet to leave room for as much sweet filling as the heart desires.

I found [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwmx0BKnbec) gave me the result that was closest to the crepes I grew up with. I iterated on the recipe a few times and this is the one I ended up with.

### Ingredients

- 2 large **eggs**
- 3 heaping tbsp **sugar**
- a generous pinch of **salt**
- 300 ml (1.25 cups) **milk** - I heat the milk up so the coconut oil will melt into the batter
- 3 tbsp **coconut oil**
- 2 tbsp **sour cream** (sub with yogurt if you don't have sour cream)
- 1/2 tsp **baking soda**
- 200 gr **flour**
- 1 cup steep **boiling water**
- *Optional* - 1 tbsp **butter**

### Steps

1. In the order listed, whisk the ingredients together.
2. I let the batter rest for a few minutes while I make coffee. I haven't tried skipping this step but I hear it lets the flour absorb the liquid and that sounds like a good thing.
3. Heat the pan on medium-high (I set mine to 6/7 out of 10). I like to use a nonstick but have done this with stainless steel many times. For the first blincik and only the first one, I'll butter the pan. Pour in 1/3 - 1/2 cup batter as you swirl the pan. It should bubble and form "lace" holes throughout the blincik. If you have any gaps, you can fill them in with additional batter.
4. Once the edges brown, flip them over and cook for half a minute or so.
5. *Optionally*, put a slice of butter between every few blinciks as you stack them.

## Notes
Apparently, having a lot of holes to make the blincik "lacey" is very desirable, according to the internet and my parents. The higher heat is important for this, so if that's not happening try upping the heat.

These stay well in the fridge for a couple of days, though we tend to eat them up by the end of the next day so I'm not sure how long they can stay for.
